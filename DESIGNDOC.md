<h3> Idea: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Name: BuissAI</li>
    <li>Goal: A customizeable AI for business to customize for their item needs</li>
    <li>
        Detail: Users will provide a file which maps prices, names and counts of items <br>
        and the AI must read these values and answer questions about the quantity and price of items.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Tools: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Language: C</li>
    <li>Reason: Although tools such as <i>Tenserflow</i> and <i>PyTorch</i> exist, they limit the learning process <br>
            and true understanding of machine learning which I am seeking.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Process: </h3>
<ol>
    <li> Use numbers to get a basic understanding of how to build a model &#10004 </li> 
    <li> Understand and implement a Seq2Seq neural network model </li>
    <li> After, allow the model to use given data from a file and answer prompts that way </li>
</ol>

<h3> Notes: </h3>
<p>
    Throughout my research for this project I discovered a neural network model which is used for
    language input and output called Seq2Seq. I will use this model in "Encoding and Decoding" the 
    user input with the expected output.<br>
</p>
<p>
    The Seq2Seq model is a version of a simpler model called <i> Long Short-Term Memory <br> (LSTM) </i>
    which uses different threads of "memory," a short term memory thread and a long therm memory <br>
    thread. <br>
    I will try implementing this model first to become more familiar with the idea of multi <br>
    output models which is key for Seq2Seq models.<br>
</p>
<p>
    While researching and learning about the <b> LSTM </b> model, I found that it is necessary to <br>
    learn and understand the <b><i> Reccurent neural Network </i></b> which use a varied size <br>
    of input values.
</p>

The two following <b> activation functions </b> will be used:
<ul>
    <li>
    $$
    Tanh Funciton:
    f(x) = \frac{exp(x) - exp(-x)}{exp(x) + exp(-x)}
    $$
    </li>
    <li>
    $$
    Sigmoid Function:
    f(x) = \frac{exp(x)}{exp(x) + 1}
    $$
    </li>
</ul>
