<h3> Idea: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Name: BuissAI</li>
    <li>Goal: A customizeable AI for business to customize for their item needs</li>
    <li>
        Detail: Users will provide a file which maps prices, names and counts of items <br>
        and the AI must read these values and answer questions about the quantity and price of items.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Tools: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Language: C</li>
    <li>Reason: Although tools such as <i>PyTorch</i> exist, they limit the learning process <br>
            and true understanding of machine learning which I am seeking.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Process: </h3>
<input type="checkbox">
    <label> Use numbers to get a basic understanding of how to build a model </label>
    <label> Proceed to use the model to guess characters instead of numbers </label>
    <label> Then connect the characters to strings and hopefully to paragraphs</label>
    <label> After, allow the model to use given data from a file and answer prompts that way </label>
</input>
